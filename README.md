# Robot Zodiac
## Abstract
A robot categorizer for the 2024 FRC season Crescendo. Personal project to build experience for future team projects involving scouting data. Is supposed to classify robots based on its performances in matches.

## Requirements
Uses `pyenv` because Arch hates Python developers. `run.sh` is just an easier way for me to execute the project.


Packages used:
- `json`
- `csv`
(that's about it)
